# Key: position is a tuple with the x-axis in String format and the y-axis in integer format.
# Value: tuple of piece type and piece colour with both values being in String format. Note that the first letter for both type and colour are capitalized as well.
# gameboard example: {('a', 0) : ('Queen', 'White'), ('d', 10) : ('Knight', 'Black'), ('g', 25) : ('Rook', 'White')}

# Return value:
# move: A tuple containing the starting position of the piece being moved to the new position for the piece. x-axis in String format and y-axis in integer format.
# move example: (('a', 0), ('b', 3))
